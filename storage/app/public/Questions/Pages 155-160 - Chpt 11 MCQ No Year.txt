A. Physical design
B. ER verification
C. Conceptual design
D. Logical design*

A. Create Relations for Strong Entities*
B. Map multivalued attributes
C. Create Relations for Weak Entities
D. Map binary relations

9. ___________________ requires the definition of specific storage or access methods that will be used by the database.
A. Logical design
B. Conceptual design
C. Translation of logical relations into tables
D. Physical design*

10. Selecting the most suitable _________________ is very important to ensure that the data is stored efficiently and data can be retrieved as quickly as possible.
A. DBMS
B. File organization*
C. Indexes
D. Logical relations

11. A ____________ is often used on multidimensional data held in data warehouses.
A. Bitmap index*
B. B-tree
C. Hashing algorithm
D. Primary index

12. Clustering is not a good idea when_______________________.
A. Database tables are frequently joined together
B. Data is regularly inserted or updated in a table*
C. There is no cluster key
D. Applications require a full database table to be scanned

13. ____________________ are usually placed on additional fields which are used regularly in user queries in order to increase the speed of data retrieval.
A. Bitmap indexes
B. Secondary indexes*
C. Unique indexes
D. Primary indexes

14. The SQL command _________is used to withdraw privileges on specific user accounts.

D. Hashed organization*

16. __________________is usually the first stage of physical database design.
A. Analyzing user queries and the size of the database
B. Determine a suitable file organization
C. Translate each relation identified in the logical data model into a table*
D. Defining indexes

17. In logical database design, when mapping binary 1:* relations.
A. Create the relations for each of the two entities that are participating in the relationship and create the foreign key on the ‘many’ side by including the primary key attribute from the ‘one’ side.*
B. Check to see if there is mandatory participation on one side of the relationship, then the entity which has the optional participation becomes the parent entity and the entity that has the mandatory relationship becomes the dependent entity. The relation corresponding to the parent entity should contain the foreign key of the dependent entity.
C. Create the relations for each of the two entities that are participating in the relationship. Then create a third relation to represent the actual relationship. The third relation will contain the foreign keys of the two original entries that participate in the original relationship.
D. Check to see if both entities are in a mandatory participation in a relationship and they do not participate in other relationships, it is then most likely that the two entities should be part of the same entity.
